        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>In this section, we dive deep into the statistical analysis of junk food consumption patterns across different age groups, regions, and socioeconomic backgrounds. We have analyzed the nutritional value of popular junk foods, examining their impact on health.</p>

        <div class="analysis-content">
            <h3>Consumption Trends</h3>
            <p>Over the last decade, junk food consumption has increased by 35% among teenagers and young adults. Fast food restaurants have become the most common source of meals for individuals aged 15-30. The most popular items are burgers, fries, and sugary drinks.</p>

            <h3>Health Impact</h3>
            <p>Our study revealed that frequent junk food consumption is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes. Children exposed to high levels of sugary snacks develop early-stage cavities and digestive issues.</p>
